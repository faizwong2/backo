# About Backo
## What is Backo?
Backo is a decentralized crowdfunding membership platform that rewards contributors with custom ERC20 tokens.

## Why Backo?
### Monthly subscription vs ICO

Most ICOs are powered by the greater fool theory as the world has experienced the roller coaster of events around the 2017 ICO scam fiasco.  Even today, scams are crawling out of the shadows, one project at a time; ‘rug pulls’, coin dumps are pretty much commonplace in the crypto community. This brings a bad reputation to the crypto community and the DeFi movement.

Among the many flaws of the ICO model is the zero return risk for investors who would like to support a project as it is not uncommon for founders to run away with only the investor’s money without actually producing anything of value. We have seen many teams who have delivered nothing but empty promises in the form of a white paper.

Founders also take the risk of misalignment of incentives when speculators are involved. When speculators are involved, the tokens usually become stores of value instead of convenient mechanisms to access network utility. In the long term, it is believed that a decentralized network will suffer when speculation of the value of the token may incentivize hoarding, leading to frequent supply shocks, and ultimately harm the network’s underlying utility.

> Tokens are not stocks. People treat them like stocks, in defi, tokens are a coordination mechanism. If you have tokens, it is because you want to be a contributor, not a bystander. There is this concept of “community”, and I think that concept is causing friction, it should not be team and community, but instead contributors. There is no separation, they are one and the same. Tokens, when designed for their specific system, don’t care about their price, it doesn’t matter, all they care about is that 1 = 1. It doesn’t matter if the token is being traded externally to the system at 1c or $1.

Monthly subscription is arguably the healthier monetization model that benefits both the users and the founders.

Monthly subscription has always been a key monetization channel for the legacy web, Web 2.0. The success of subscription based models like Netflix and Spotify have other incumbents such as Apple and Amazon starting to copy them.

The subscriber can put in small amounts, has the freedom to evaluate the service and cancel it at anytime. This mitigates the risk of spending a significant amount of capital upfront with a possibility of not getting anything of value in return. For the service provider, a subscription business model means a reliable and predictable revenue stream and more direct customer feedback. They get to focus on making their customers happy as opposed to having two actors: speculators and users.

### Zero censorship

The crowdfunding site Patreon has received backlash by banning several prominent content creators from its platform. While the company insists that each was in violation of its terms or service, these recent expulsions have been argued to be more readily explained by political bias.

We have also seen top Patreon creators deleted their accounts out of integrity at the expense of losing a platform for supporters to fund their work.

Backo makes crowdfunding accessible to all, by utilizing blockchain technology to remove centralized control of a subscription platform. Any creator can create a backo, which is a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, an automated computer program that allows interaction between creators and supporters without third parties and any fees. Creators have full control of their backo contract, and it will always be operational as long as Ethereum exists.

### Backo vs other crowdfunding membership platforms

Backo is unique in a way that it does not rely on pure donations. Contributors to a backo will be rewarded with custom ERC20 tokens of which its utility can be determined by the creator.

The success of a platform like Patreon could be attributed to the fact that it allows members to receive rewards and perks by subscribing to a Patreon as opposed to giving pure donations out of charity. 

Backo brings this model a step further by tokenizing these perks, allowing members to physically own the reward from contributing to a backo, secured by the blockchain. The reward tokens are ERC20 tokens, which is the defacto token standard on Ethereum. This allows the flexibility of creators to devise a utility of the token up to their creativity.

Open source decentralized protocol developers could integrate the backo reward tokens as the utility token of their protocol or as the governance token representing the voting power in a decentralized autonomous organization. The reward token could also be used as a cryptocurrency to purchase exclusive content or official merchandise from a creator.

## How does it work?
A creator can create a backo contract from the frontend client web application.  This will deploy a backo contract to the Ethereum blockchain and the creator will receive the address of the deployed backo contract. The creator can then now share the backo address to users.

A user could interact with a backo by going to the backo page on the web application. A backo page can be accessed by inputting the backo address to the site. A user may pick a membership level, and choose how many rounds to subscribe for. Once subscribed, a user may cancel anytime in which the deposited funds when subscribing are returned to the user.

The creator can collect funds from the backo every 172800 Ethereum blocks (approximately a month) since the creation of the backo contract. Once the creator has collected their fund, they have ended the round and started a new one. Contributors to the ended round will be rewarded with the reward token based on their membership level.
